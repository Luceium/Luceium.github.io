            This page in and of it's self is a fun project that I am learning from. I've learned the basics of html and css. 
            I'm enjoying coustomizing the page to create what i've drawn. Going forward I may use a template since my goal is not to become a web developer. 
            My mission is to become a mobile developer.
            <br>
            Update: I am not going to use a template. I am really having fun learning how to make websites and despite having no intention of becomeing a web dev. 
            I find it fun and valuable to learn new skills, even if they're for web dev.

                I have unfortunately discovered that recursion by use of iframe has been patched because it used to be an issue that caused browsers to crash.
                I was excited to do recursion the second I learned about how iframe works.
                So, I tried to implement recursion by having two pages that point at eachother but that didn't seem to work.
                I later learned that iframe prevents recursion by checking to see if it's self is among the list of parent pages so to speak.
                All in all it was pretty fun and cool to learn about this history and how developers "patched" it.

            <h1>3/5/2022</h1>
            <p>
                I decided to update my display to show two iframes pointing at eachother
                from seprate files. I also made this page not be included in the recursion
                to avoid the blog being seen twice. The final touches were some colors
                and text to seperate them using a costume CSS file. While this all sounds great
                it is important to note that I spent hours debugging because on this page
                I used href instead of src in the iframe declaration. As a novice, self learning developer
                I used the two terms interchangably. Now I will remember that src is something to load
                while an href is a link to take you somewhere. I made this connection by
                comparing and contrasting img and a tags.

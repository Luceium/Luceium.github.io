        I have unfortunately discovered that recursion by use of iframe has been patched because it used to be an issue that caused browsers to crash.
        It was an intersting history lesson I wasn't planning to learn.
        I was excited to do recursion the second I learned about how iframe works.
        Lastly, I tried to implement recursion by having two pages that point at eachother but that didn't seem to work.
        I later learned that iframe checks to see if it's self is among the list of parent pages so to speak.
        All in all it was pretty fun and cool to learn about this history and how developers "patched" it.
